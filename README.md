# Proofer
"Proofer" is a program that allows users to design, customize, and solve geometric proofs. Behind the scenes is a portable proof-solving engine that does the hard work.

The user first designs the proof's diagram by adding triangles, segments, circles, and polygons. The user can arrange them to their liking.
<br>
Next, in the "Given" section, the user can add a variety of relationships between the figures, such as:
  * "Angle ABC is a right angle"
  * "Segments AB and CD are congruent"

Lasty, the user enters the proof goal, i.e., the relationship that they want to the computer to prove. And... that's it. Once the "Prove" button is clicked, the engine handles the rest.

Here's an example:
