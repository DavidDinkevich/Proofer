Title: PROOFER JOURNAL

TODO:
- Problem with using strings to look up figures is that I don't know if you want a triangle or angle--no way to differentiate (just right angles, but that doesn't apply in all situations). Currently attempting to get rid of this practice and see what happens.

- Diagram 176 should throw NullPointerException
- Diagram maybe make makeRightAngle() private?
- IMPLEMENT ANGLE SYNONYMS (try isosceles example)

2/6/19
- Finish implementing new selector in InputManager--many methods still use Polygons as basis, not VertexShape
- Figure out what to do with the Selectable interface, maybe in createSelector() and destroySelector() pass the full GraphicsShape in as opposed to just the shape
- Retrofit VertexBuffer to work with VertexShapes and vertices, not Polygons

2/7/19
- Did all above
- Move UIDiagramLayers to AdvancedCanvas
- Create ProofUtils

2/8/19
- COMPLETED: Move UIDiagramLayers to AdvancedCanvas
- COMPLETED: Create ProofUtils
- COMPLETED: crossed off some TODOs
- Add hidden vertices, chop segments
2/9/19
- COMPLETED: add hidden vertices
- COMPLETED: Chop segments
- Fully support iscosceles
2/10/19
- Got stuck on a TON of bugs: 
- Bug 1: Slopes that should have been considered equal were not due to tiny rounding errors, thereby creating
-            angles out of 2 parallel segments
- Bug 2: Invisible hidden figures not being deleted when they became outdated.
- Bug 3: Implemented Diagram Policies
- COMPLETED: Made canvas and FigureRelationListPanel grow/shrink when the window is resized
- FUTURE: Fully support isosceles, supplementary/complementary, parallel lines + transversals
2/19/19
- Tons of planning for the implementation of CompoundFigureRelations and Addition Postulate
- FUTURE: implement CompoundFigureRelations
- FUTURE: integrate midpoint and CompoundFigureRelations
- FUTURE: if <A is a right angle, and <A = <B, then <B is a right angle
- FUTURE: Fully support isosceles, supplementary/complementary, parallel lines + transversals
2/20/19
- COMPLETED: fixed bug where when two segments intersected and the point of intersection was
                        one of the endpoints of the segment, the new hidden segments were not added
- FUTURE: implement CompoundFigureRelations
- FUTURE: integrate midpoint and CompoundFigureRelations
- FUTURE: if <A is a right angle, and <A = <B, then <B is a right angle
- FUTURE: Fully support isosceles, supplementary/complementary, parallel lines + transversals
